# AP-Module-Cpp-Monday-Exercises
This repository contains the Monday exercises from the 'Advanced Programming Module'.

## Exercise 1: Quote a quote
Quotation marks are often used to denote the start and end of a string. However, sometimes we need to print out the quotation marks (both single and/or double quotes) themselves using escape characters (a.k.a. escape sequences).

This C++ program prompts the user for a quote and then for an author, here is the formatted questions with some sample output:
```
What is the quote? The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.
Who said it? Walt Disney

Walt Disney says: “The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.”
```

## Exercise 2: Temperature Conversion
A C++ program that converts temperatures from Fahrenheit to Centigrade and Centigrade to Fahrenheit based on the user’s input. This program prompts the user for a starting temperature followed by which type of conversion to perform the conversion with.

Example output:
```
Please enter the starting temperature: 60.1
Press ‘C’ to convert from Fahrenheit to Centigrade.
Press ‘F’ to convert from Centigrade to Fahrenheit.

Your choice: C
60.1 degrees Fahrenheit is 15.6111
```

## Exercise 3: Area of a Rectangle
When working in a global environment (and building on the work I completed in exercise 2) there is often a requirement to present information using different standards – in this exercise I was required to convert values between imperial and metric units.

I created a C++ program that prompts the user for the length and width of a room in feet then display the area in both feet and meters squared; the expected output is shown below:
```
What is the length of the room in feet? 15
What is the width of the room in feet? 20

Your room’s dimension is 15 by 20 feet, the area is:
300 square foot
27.809 square meters
```
